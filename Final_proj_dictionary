File Variable Definitions: 
1. pitch_type: The type of pitch derived from Statcast.

2. release_speed: Pitch velocities from 2008-16 are via Pitch F/X, and adjusted 
to roughly out-of-hand release point. All velocities from 2017 and beyond are
Statcast, which are reported out-of-hand.

3. horiz_release: Horizontal Release Position of the ball measured in feet
from the catcher's perspective.

4. vert_release: Vertical Release Position of the ball measured in feet from 
the catcher's perspective.

5. zone: Zone location of the ball when it crosses the plate from 
the catcher's perspective. (The strike zone is broken into 9 quadrants, top left,
top middle, top right...continue for middle and low. Non 1-9 numbers are out of zone)

6. batter_side: Side of the plate batter is standing.

12. vert_pos: Vertical position of the ball when it crosses home plate from the catcher's
perspective.

13. effective_speed: Derived speed based on the the extension of the pitcher's

14. release_spin_rate: Spin rate of pitch tracked by Statcast.

15. release_extension: Release extension of pitch in feet as tracked by Statcast.

16. Pitcher: MLB Player Id tied to the play event.

17. dist_from_home: Release position of pitch measured in feet from the catcher's
perspective.

18. pitch_name: The name of the pitch derived from the Statcast Data.

19. spin_axis: The Spin Axis in the 2D X-Z plane in degrees from 0 to 360,
such that 180 represents a pure backspin fastball and 0 degrees represents
a pure topspin (12-6) curveball

20. description: Description of the resulting pitch.

21. whiff: Binary variable descriping if the pitch
resulted in a swing and miss (1 means miss, everything else)
