File Variable Definitions: 
1. pitch_type: The type of pitch derived from Statcast.

2. release_speed: Pitch velocities from 2008-16 are via Pitch F/X, and adjusted 
to roughly out-of-hand release point. All velocities from 2017 and beyond are
Statcast, which are reported out-of-hand.

3. release_pos_x: Horizontal Release Position of the ball measured in feet
from the catcher's perspective.

4. release_pos_z: Vertical Release Position of the ball measured in feet from 
the catcher's perspective.

5. Zone: Zone location of the ball when it crosses the plate from 
the catcher's perspective. (The strike zone is broken into 9 quadrants, top left,
top middle, top right...continue for middle and low. Non 1-9 numbers are out of zone)

6. stand: Side of the plate batter is standing.

7. p_throws: Hand pitcher throws with.

8. type: Short hand of pitch result. B = ball, S = strike, X = in play.

9. pfx_x: Horizontal movement in feet from the catcher's perspective.

10. pfx_z: Vertical movement in feet from the catcher's perpsective.

11. plate_x: Horizontal position of the ball when it crosses home plate 
from the catcher's perspective.

12. plate_z
Vertical position of the ball when it crosses home plate from the catcher's
perspective.

13. effective_speed: Derived speed based on the the extension of the pitcher's 
release.

14. release_spin: Spin rate of pitch tracked by Statcast.

15. release_extension: Release extension of pitch in feet as tracked by Statcast.

16. Pitcher: MLB Player Id tied to the play event.

17. release_pos_y: Release position of pitch measured in feet from the catcher's
perspective.

18. estimated_ba_using_speedangle: Estimated Batting Avg based on launch 
angle and exit velocity.

19. estimated_woba_using_speedangle: Estimated wOBA based on launch angle and 
exit velocity.

20. pitch_name: The name of the pitch derived from the Statcast Data.

21. spin_axis: The Spin Axis in the 2D X-Z plane in degrees from 0 to 360,
such that 180 represents a pure backspin fastball and 0 degrees represents
a pure topspin (12-6) curveball

22. description: Description of the resulting pitch.
