Identifying Information
For this project, the team looked at Major League Baseball pitching data from the 2022 season. The data was scraped from MLB page Baseball Savant, which uses MLB's statcast data and creates graphics, charts, comparisons and more. The intention of the project is to look at which pitching variables were the most important in the outcome of a whiff. We chose whiff because at its root it is the most dominant result a single pitch can get. There are so many ways a pitch can be effective
